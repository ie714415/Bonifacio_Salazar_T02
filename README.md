First of all we make a sort algorithm to get all priorities from tasks in order. 
Once this is made, we make comparisons iterating among all tasks on list comparing if the actual priority task matches the one frome the sorted array.
The algorithm we used was a quick sort to get all priorities in order and this is made after the declaration of all the tasks involved on the program. 

Each time a Tick interruption is made, we used the sorted array to compare wether the priority from array matched the priority from nextTask.
